My JavaScript code utilizes several ES6 features. Here are some of them:

1. Arrow Functions
2. Template Literals
3. Destructuring Assignment
4. Spread Operator
5. Promises and async/await
6. const and let

Summary
My code prominently uses arrow functions, template literals, and async/await for handling asynchronous operations. This improves readability and maintainability.
